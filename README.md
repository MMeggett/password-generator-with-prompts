# <Password-Generator-With-Prompts>

## Description

This project was built with the intention of allowing users to make a secure password. It allows users to choose the type of characters they want to have available in their password. While building this I became more comfortable using prompts and special characters.

## Usage

Users enter a number between 8 and 128 to determine the length of the password. After choosing a length they are given a variety of prompts to determine the type of characters they want to have in their password. After answering all of the prompts a password is generated for the user.
